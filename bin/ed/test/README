The .t and .d and .r files in this directory are used for testing ed.
To run the tests, set the ED variable in the Makefile for the path name
of the program to be tested (e.g., /bin/ed), and type `make'.

Some spurious data may appear as the test runs.  Errors appear
as:
	*** The script u.ed exited abnormally ***
or:
	*** Output u.o of script u.ed is incorrect ***

It is assumed that the ed being tested processes escapes (\) in file names.
This is so that a name starting with bang (!) can be read, via:
	r \!file
Without the escape, a POSIX ed would attempt to read the output of
the shell command `file'.

Though numerous, the tests are very incomplete.  Please send any new
tests/bug reports to: alm@netcom.com
