This is the directory to use for creating a library of the dbopen(3)
routines.  The Makefile builds the base system.  By changing it and
the compat.h file, you should be able to pick and choose the various
things your system needs to make libdb run.

The knobs that you may have to turn:

In the Makefile:
	If you don't have mktemp or mkstemp on your system, add
	"mktemp.o" to the COMP list.

In include/compat.h:
	Before attempting to build this library, you should skim through
	the compat.h file, and adjust it as necessary for your system.
	It's possible to use the #ifndef construct to figure out if a
	#ifdef has been set, but C provides no similar method to figure
	out if a typedef has been done.  All of the typedef's are grouped
	at the top of compat.h, your compile errors will tell you which
	ones you need.

Some other problems:
	You may see warning messages about illegal pointer combinations.
	It's because systems prototype malloc, calloc and realloc in
	different places.  If you want to stop the warnings, find out
	where your system prototypes them, and include it in compat.h,
	or, just prototype them yourself.

	The dbopen(3) routines also use the snprintf(3) function.  If
	you don't have this function, change the snprintf() call in
	btree/bt_open.c:tmp() from snprintf() to sprintf(), making sure
	to delete the SECOND argument, the size of the buffer.

To install:
	Programs using the dbopen(3) interface have to include db.h.
	To install the library, you'll need to put db.h (found in the
	directory PORT/include) and the library libdb.a in some place
	accesible to your program.
