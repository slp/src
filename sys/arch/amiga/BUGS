Current list as of 93-7-5:

Those I'm aware of:
-  nfsd and mountd crash regularly when going to multiuser mode...
-  the console seems to have some problems displaying text when parity is
   enabled. This shows in a distorted login-prompt (multiuser mode).
-  the vt200 emulator is really far from perfect, and needs a lot more work
   to be honestly called a vt200 (or vt320 even) emulator.
-  the console chops the rightmost character, I guess this is a problem of
   the display-window, not of the bitmap drawing itself.
-  8bit characters are all displayed as ^@. Problems could lie in wrong tty
   settings or the ite driver.
-  although autoconfig information is passed into the kernel and the hardware
   table is generated, no I/O-space is currently allocated in kernel VM for 
   boards. This will probably be one of the first things to fix or nobody is 
   able to access their boards under BSD ...
-  sun-style disklabels are not yet supported.
-  disklabels can't be written back to disk. You'll have to configure your
   drives under amigados (with hdtoolbox), and just format the partitions
   under BSD. I think this is a tolerable limitation.
-  there's currently no provision for reading the realtime-clock, so time
   is always set using the last modification date of the mounted root 
   filesystem.
-  severe crash after dumping to disk...

to be continued...
