should understand "older", original High Sierra ("CDROM001") type
should understand Rockridge
should be called cdfs, as there are other ISO filesystem soon possible
should have file handles implemented for use with NFS, etc
should have name translation enabled by mount flag
should run as a user process, and not take up kernel space (cdroms are slow)
